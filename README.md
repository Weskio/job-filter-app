## :dart: About ##

The Job Filter App is a web application designed to streamline the job search process by allowing users to filter through job listings based on specific criteria. Users are presented with job cards containing details such as role, language, and position. They can easily filter these job listings by selecting relevant tags. For example, if a job has tags like "Frontend", "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", and "Senior", users can filter the job lists by selecting "Frontend" and "HTML", resulting in only job listings that match these criteria being displayed. This application simplifies the job search experience, providing users with a more efficient way to find relevant job opportunities.
